Hey, my name is Ben, also known as “highjack” online. I’ve been interested in computers since the age of 6 when my parents brought me an Amiga 500. I like to break things, it’s not a hobby, it’s a passion, it’s what I do inside and outside of work and I can’t see that ever changing. I’m addicted to hacking. I can’t stop myself but to prod and poke things, figure out how they work and then try and get them to do stuff they aren’t meant to do.

I specialise in testing web apps which stems from the first scripting language I ever properly learnt which was PHP. After Uni I worked as a PHP developer for a couple of years but security has always been my where my heart it. So the obvious path for me was to learn about web app security.

I also venture off into many other areas of security. I like playing with exploit development, I can manage stack based buffer overflows, format string issues and have built a few ROP chains but I still struggle with heap overflows. I’m not the best reverse engineer but I will give it a good go and I’d say I’m medicore at “traditional” network pentesting/red teaming, I certainly know enough to get by, meaning I’m probably on par with some of the APT groups but I think the “Advanced” part of the acronym is often debatable based on some of the write ups I’ve read. I mean I get it, if there is a super easy way to get a shell why would you bother with anything else. Not that I condone that sort of behavior ;)

I’ve been trying to get into bug bounties recently but my free time is quite limited out of work if I find anything cool I will post it. Don’t worry I won’t be posting poor quality write ups just to show you how much money I’ve made. I’m trying to shoe horn some automated recon system using kubernetes currenly and when it is in some kind of operational order I will share it online. I don’t mind recon, but I’m more of a deep dive kind of guy.

My blog just contains a few old CTF write ups for now but I plan on working on it, to include many of the topics that I am interested in. There’s some links to some old vulnerabilities I have reported too, I haven’t done this in a good while, a certain company that I won’t name threatened me to throw me in jail for writing a blog post (after a fix was available) because they wanted to silently patch it and not make the customer’s aware of the issue.

I’m not doing this for money or fame, it’s mostly just a scratch pad for me to dump my findings on but if even just one person out there learns something from my content then that’s an added bonus.
